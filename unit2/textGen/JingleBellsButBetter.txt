Jingle all the way Oh, what fun it is to ride In one horse open sleigh And hitch him to ride In one horse open sleigh, hey! 
Jingle all the way Oh, what fun it is to ride and sing A sleighing song tonight, oh! 
Dashing through the way Bells on bobtails ring Making spirits bright What fun it is to ride In a one-horse open sleigh, hey! 
Jingle all the way Oh, jingle bells Jingle bells, jingle bells Jingle bells, jingle bells Jingle bells, jingle bells Jingle bells, jingle bells Jingle bells, jingle bells Jingle all the way Oh, what fun it is white Go it is to ride and sing A sleighing song Get a one-horse open sleigh Oh, what fun it is white Go it is to ride and sing A sleighing song tonight, oh!
