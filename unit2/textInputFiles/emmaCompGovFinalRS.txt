other words, more than one legislature seat is contested in each district
→ Voters can cast their ballots for a party rather than a candidate

UNIT 2: GREAT BRITAIN
Brexit
british exit from the European Union in 2016

Margaret Thatcher 
1979, Margaret Thatcher of the Conservatuve Party was the first leader of an industrial democracy to experiment with neoliberal economic policies in an attempt to stem economic decline
These policies were very controversial 
Thatcher resigned in 1990

Conservatives (Tories)
Even with thatcher's resignation, the Conservatives remained in power until the 1997 election, when they were used by the Labour Party 

The Labor Party and Tony Blair
Tony Blair = leader of the Labor party
Under the leadership of Tony Blair and his successor Gordon Brown, the Labour Party sought to soften some of the harder edges of Thatcher’s neoliberalism while still embracing many of the policies executed by her and her conservative successor 
Neoliberalism is used to describe modern day examples of increased capitalism
Usually about world bank or IMF trying to make countries more capitalist

The Third Way
A political compromise between the right and the left that influenced similar centrist policies in the United States, Germany, and elsewhere and also informed the improbable coalition that governed Britain from 2010-2015

David Cameron
David Cameron and the Conservatives won an outright majority in the 2015 election and pursued a more neoliberal platform, policies that Cameron’s successor, Conservtive Prime Minister Theresa May, once again tempered

Thersea May
Conservative prime minister
The capacity of May’s government to carry out domestic reforms, as well as its ability to negotiate Britain's departure from the European Union, were severely weakened by the Conservative Party’s losses in a 2017 election
May’s failure to deliver the Brexit deal forced her resignation

Boris Johnson 
“Brexiteer”, May’s successor
Able to push through a Brexit deal and regain Conservative majority

United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland
Formed name of the UK
Separated by France, Great Britain itself consists of 3 nations
England
Scotland
Wales
Roughly the size of Oregon
65 million residents
5 of every 6  Britons living in England
UK = multethnic state	
Contains Scottish, Welsh, and English citizens, who have distinct cultures and languages
Nonwhite population = 13% of total population

UK = highly majoritarian features in democracy 
The majority in parliament has had virtually unchecked power
The majority party in the UK has been able to enact policies with few checks from other branches of government
British constitution contains no formal limits on the central government, few judicial restraints, and no constitutionally sanctioned local authorities to dilute the power of the government in london 

Essential political features
Legislative-executive system
Parliamentary 
Legislature: parliament
Lower house: house of commons 
Upper house: House of lords
Unitary or federal division of power: Unitary 
Main geographic subunits: England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland
Electoral system for lower house: Single-member districts with plurality
Chief judicial body: Supreme court

The Crown
The crown, legislature, the prime minister, the cabinet, and the judiciary = main branches of government
British crown = head of state
Crown = embodied by the monarch
Acts as a purely ceremonial figure 
British monarch today is essentially a paid civil servant: the government allocated a budget to cover the royal family’s expenses, and the queen spends much of her time signing papers, dedicating public works, and performing diplomatic functions
Monarch always selects head of government, but the choice must alway be the leader of the largest party in the lower house of parliament
Monarch = commander of the british armed forces, but prime minister has power to declare war and sign treaties

Branches of government
Prime minister
Head of government
Must be an elected member of the legislature
Head of the largest party in the lower house, the house of commons
As with any other member of parliament (MP), prime ministers are elected to a maximum term of 5 years
Before the passage of a 2011 Fixed-Term parliament act, the prime minister could choose to call elections at any time before the term expired 
 Vote of no confidence
Can occur when the chamber rejects a measure deemed of high importance to the government
Either the entire cabinet must resign (and be replaced by a new one) or new elections must be called (if no government can be formed that can gain the confidence of the House of Commons within 2 weeks)
Must appear in the legislature weekly for a televised question period
Must direct the activity of the cabinet and smooth over differences among cabinet members
Expected to provide a national leadership
Also diplomats and world leaders
Because prime ministers are normally political veterans, more than 2 decades of experience in the house of commons, they are usually outstanding debaters, effective communicators, and skilled negotiators

*p. 323 = structure of the government

The cabinet 
Cabinets evolved out of the group of experts who originally advised Britain's monarchs
Contemporary british cabinets have about 20 members, all of whom must be MPs
Usually from the lower house but occasionally are members of the upper house, the House of Lords
cabinet members preside over their individual government departments and are responsible for answering to Parliament about actions of the bureaucracies they oversee
Most important ministries = Foregin Office (conducts foregin policy), the Home Office (oversees the judiciary), and the Exchequer (whose minister, called the chancellor, oversees financial policy)
Unwritten rule of cabinet behavior = collective responsibility
when individual cabinet ministers oppose a given policy, the entire cabinet must appear unified and take responsibility for the policy
Cabinet members who cannot support a decision must resign and return top legislature 

The Legislature 
Parliament 
Most powerful legislature on earth, due largely to the lack of constitutional constraints
2 chambers
House of commons
Consists of 650 members representing individual districts
Elected for a max term of five years
House of lords
Upper house not only because it represented the top aristocracy but also because it was at the time considered the more powerful of the two chambers
Today, house of lords is nearly powerless
Composed of 800 members, or peers, who have been appointed in a variety of ways
Life peers = distinguished citizens appointed for life by the crown on the recommendation of the prime minister
About a dozen members of the church of england are also members
Another dozen, known as law lords, are top legal experts, appointed for life, who played an important role in legal appeals until recent reforms transferred their judicial responsibilities out of the upper chamber
Most controversial part = hereditary peers
Members of the aristocracy (dukes, earls, barons, and so on) who until recently had been able to bequeath their seats to their offspring
In 1999, the automatic rights of hereditary peers to sit in the house of lords was abolished and the number of hereditary peers was limited to 92
Has no actual veto power over legislation
Legislature ratifies, deliberates, and scrutinizes policies that are proposed by the executive

The Judiciary 
Until recently there was no tradition of judicial review because british parliament was always supreme: any law passed by the legislature was, by definition, constitutional
The role of the courts has been mainly to ensure that parliamentary statutes have been followed
All current supreme court justices are also law lords from the house of lords, selected from among distinct jurists by the lord chancellor and serving until retirement 
The border legal system, based on common law and developed in the twelfth century, contrasts starkly with the stricter code law practiced in the rest of europe, which is less focused on precedent and interpretation

The Electoral System
Uses single-member district system based on plurality voting
The system favors and help maintains the dominance of the two main political parties, Labour and Conservative
The system consistently penalizes smaller parties 
United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP) 
Nearly 13% of the popular vote was widely dispersed, yielding only one parliamentary seat
Scottish National Party (SNP)
In a system that gives virtually unchecked power to the party with the majority of seats, an electoral process artificially producing majorities could be considered a serious distortion of democratic rule

Local Government
Parliament remains fully sovereign and can enact laws at any time to limit or even eliminate this devolved authority 
Britain's upper chamber is unelected and therefore not accountable to states or other regional bodies
British localities have enjoyed a long tradition of powerful local government
Recently, under the promise of creating a “big society,” conservative governments have sought to continue this process of devolution, requiring greater transparency in local government and giving local citizens more decision-making power regarding local taxation and public services
Representation at the regional level has historically been very limited
Of the 4 nations, only northern ireland had its own legislature, until political violence caused the central government to disband it in 1972
The Labour party promoted devolution
1998, Good Friday Agreement between Catholics and Protestants in Northern Ireland allowed for the reestablishment of the Northern Ireland Assembly
England, which is the seat of british national government, is the only party of the UK without its own regional government

The Party System
Majority party controls government
Liberal Democratic Party
Newly emerged
United Kingdom Independence Party 
newly emerged
Gaining prominence
Support has surged for nationalist parties in Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland
Since the Conservatives and Labour continue to prevail, the current system is often called a two-and-a-half-party system, in which the Liberal democratic party trails far behind the 2 other parties

The Labour Party
Formed in 1900 as an outgrowth of the trade union movement
Initially sought to give the British working class a voice in Parliament
Labour’s turning point and its emergence as one of the United Kingdom’s 2 dominant parties came with its landslide victory in 1945, just after WWII
British Labour Party considered socialism its dominant ideological characteristic
British socialists, however, were influenced by Fabianism, a moderate ideology that advocated working within the parliamentary order to bring about social-democratic change
Labour party depending heavily on working class votes (for most of its history)
Starting in 1970s, the composition of the class structure began to change as fewer Britons engaged in working-class jobs
By mid-late 1970s, the Labour Party was badly divided between radical socialists, who wanted the party to move to the left to shore up its working-class credentials, and moderates, who wanted it to move toward the political center
1980s-1990s, the Labour Party began a process of ideological and organizational moderation
Party’s constitution was rewritten to weaken severely the ability of trade union to control party policy
Labour also abandoned its commitment to socials and advocated a cross-class appeal
Jeremy Corbyn ⇒ replaced Ed Miliband; a decisive figure initially well loved by many of the party’s rank and file but highly unpopular among Labour’s more moderate leadership
Corbyn led the party to a strong finish in the 2017 election, but gave back those gains and more in 2019 election, handing the Conservatives their largest majority since the Thatcherite victories of the 1980s

The Conservative Party
Tories → moderate right
Emerged in the late 1700s and have come to be identified not only with the democratization of the UK but also with the origins of the British welfare state through the post-WWII collectivist consensus
David Cameron → under his leadership, the Tories forged a more coherent and more centrist ideological position, captured in Cameron’s call for a “big society” and more socially liberal policies regarding abortion and gay rights
Conservative party continues to be plagued by fault lines that have persisted within the party since the 1970s
In the wake of the 2008-2009 financial crisis, Cameron’s push for austerity measures and call for leaner government cheered some but angered others
Cameron renegotiated some terms of Britain's EU membership and brought this new arrangement to the British people in 2016 in an “in” or “out” referendum 
British voters chose to exit the EU, leading Cameron to take responsibility for the vote and step down as prime minister
Cameron’s successor Theresea May sought to restore party unity and obtain a strong mandate to negotiate a favorable Brexit deal 
May failed, and Johnson, after threatening to crash out of the EU was able to negotiate a Brexit Deal, win a thumping majority in a snap general election, and secure Britain's withdrawal from the EU

The Liberal Democrats
A 3rd party for voters embracing a range of values and political positions
Formed in 1988 through the merger of the Liberal Party and defectors from the Labour Party
Ideology is a mixture of classical liberalism’s emphasis on both individual freedom and a weak state and social democracy’s emphasis on collective equality 
Consistent supporters of European integration and were staunch opponents of the war in Iraq
Often attacked New Labour’s policies as too timid and have frequently called for increased taxation and social spending
Have consistently called for electoral reform that would give Britain a system rewarding parties with seats in proportion to their votes
They were unable to persuade their Tory coalition partner to agree only to a much more modest proposal, which predictably failed 
Also secured a promise from Conservatives that the coalition government would put forward a bill to reform the House of Lords
The SMD system prevented the party from translating votes into additional seats in Parliament

Other parties
The main impediment to the success of small parties remains the structure of the electoral system, since plurality SMD systems tend to work against small parties that fail to win a plurality of votes
Nigel Farage = UKIP former leader, brought a great deal of publicity and popular support to the party
Farage launched the Brexit Party in 2019
Like the UKIP, the party is populist and Eurosceptic, calling for the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the EU as a means to regain British sovereignty
Brexit party captured more votes and seats that any other political party in the 2019 elections

Party Politics Today
2015 elections, although voters ended the hung parliament by awarding a majority of seats to the Conservatives, the two leading parties together won only ⅔ of the vote, with the remaining third divided among a variety of parties
If British policies are supposed to be about staid traditions and predictable continuity, trends in the past 3 elections and disputes and divisions in all three major parties seem to be challenging these conventions
In 2015, support for regional and single-issue parties surged at the expense of the large parties
Since the 2015 election all 3 major parties have swapped out their leaders
Party politics - and democracy- remain alive and well in contemporary Britain

Elections
British voters select 650 members of the House of Commons during general elections
Set on a 5 year term beginning with the 2015 election 
British campaigns are short affairs, usually lasting less than a month
The voter has a relatively simple choice: which party should govern?
Compared to the US, UK voters are much more likely to know what each party stands for and how the parties differ
Tend to focus on differences between parties rather than differences between candidates 

Civil Society
The UK houses various groups articulating special interests
British interest groups influence public policy and public opinion, but interest-group lobbying of MPs is far less prevalent than such lobbying in the US congress bc British parties are more highly disciplined 
Interest groups focus their attention of the party leadership and on the government bureaucracies, which often interpret and apply policies
Quangos
Quasi-autonomous nongovernmental organizations
Quangos are policy advisory boards or other entities appointed or approved by the government that bring government officials and affected interest groups together to help develop policy 
First established in 1960s-1970s
Represent a move toward a social-democratic model of public policy making, in which government and interest groups work together to develop policy 
Trades Union Congress (TUC) = a confederation of the UK’s largest trade unions
Most important interest group
A variety of factors have weakened the TUC since it dominated the Labour Party in much of the postwar period
The number of blue-collar workers is shrinking quickly
Conservative governments starting with Margaret Thatcher’s have sharply reduced the political power of the TUC by passing laws designed to restrict union activity 
Reforms within the Labour party since 1990s severely eroded the TUC’s control of that party
Most important business in the UK and the main counterweight of the TUC = Confederation of British Industry (CBI)
CBI has no direct link to the Tories
Main industrial and financial interests in the UK usually favor Conservative Policy

Society 
UK’s social makeup is divided in many significant ways
British state is both multinational and multiethnic
British society reveals class, religious, and even linguistic divisions

Class Identity 
One of the most salient of all social divisions
Increased social mobility has not yet erased the perception of a two-tier society divided by an upper and working class
Class differences are also perpetuated by continued self-identification with either the upper or working class, as manifested in preferred tastes and leisure activities and variations in speech or accent
Sherry vs. warm beer
Cricket vs. football
Opera vs. pub

Ethnic and National Identity
Examples of ethnic tensions
2005 london bombings by islamic extremists
Racially charged riots across england in 2011
Religiously oriented social issues in the UK, such as gay rights and abortion, have generally not become polarized
Religion remains a source of conflict in Northern Ireland, where roughly half of the citizens are protestant and the other half are catholic
Northern Ireland, also known as Ulster, comprises the northeastern portion of the island of Ireland
Religious divided due to national and class differences, and Catholics were discriminated against in both employment and education
The Troubles
1960s, members of the Irish Republican Army (IRA) turned to violence against British targets in the hope of unifying the region with the Republic of Ireland, and the British army and illegal protestant paramilitary fought back
Claimed nearly 4,000 casualties on both sides
1990s, the British government and IRA began talks with the aim of establishing peace
Resulted in 1998 Good Friday Agreement
Bound the IRA to renounce its armed struggle in return for political reforms that would give the Catholic population greater say in local government
Authorized the creation of a Northern Irish legislature and a voting system ensuring proportional representation
Guaranteed an open border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, a condition made much simpler by the fact that both Ireland and the UK were members of the EU
Racial tension between the overwhelming majority of white and the non-European minorities has sparked conflict and anti-immigration sentiment, both of which nonetheless remain moderate by American and Continental standards
Parliament has also sought to limit the nonwhite population by imposing quotes that restrict the entrance of nonwhite dependents of persons already residing in the UK
The UK also comprises a number of national groups
Most people in UK don’t say there are british but claim themselves as one of these 4 nationalities
Wales
Scottish 
English
Irish
UK growing economic and cultural integration with Europe over the past decades and, at the same time, its growing ambivalence about this dependence and decision to weaken those ties by exiting the EU

Ideology and Political Culture
British political values have been strongly influenced by the development of classical liberalism and the conviction that government’s influence over individuals out to be limited
Post War goals of expanded franchise, full employment, and the creation of a welfare state led to a new consensus as many Britons embraced the social-democratic values of increased state interventions and less individual freedom in exchange for increase social equality
Electoral success of the Labour party in 1997 led to new policy to reconcile social-democratic and liberal ideologies - the so called third way
Most British tend to be more socially and morally liberal than citizens of the US
The UK outlawed capital punishment and legalized abortion and homosexulaity, all in the mid-1960s
Same-sex marriage banned in england since 2013, scotland since 2014, and northern ireland since 2020
Political culture = pragmatic and tolerant
Thought to be less concerned with adhering to overarching ideological principles and more willing to tinker gradually with a particular political problem
Political radicalism is rare in the UK
Virtually all political actors embrace the willingness to seek evolutionary not revolutionary change
Brexi polarized British political culture more than any previous issue in history 
Attitudes towards sovereignty and issues such as EU membership and immigration cut across traditional cleavages such as party and ideology 
British political culture in reality comprises multiple subcultures
Aristocratic culture among the political elite
Share a sense of superiority and noblesse oblige toward those they deem less able to rule
Mass or working class culture
Derence to those in authority 
Policies of devolution, immigration, and multiculturalism, combined with the blurring of class lines, have challenged and complicated these dominant subcultures

Political Economy 
The UK noteworthy for it contribution to the liberal economic model
Liberalism in the UK has undergone a number of shifts over the past decades, from the greater emphasis on social-democratic values after WWII to the neo-liberalism under Margaret Thatcher, which has been softened but largely continued in subsequent governments 
Why the decline in the economy?
Downslide of early industrialization, which made the country the world’s first industrial power but later allowed it to be the first country to face the obsolescence of its technology and the difficulty of shifting to a new economic environment 
The burden of the empire
The empire became and industrial drain on the country rather than a benefit to it 
Many political analysts have argued that the collectivist consensus not only blocked meaningful economic reform in the UK for much of the postwar period but also focused the country on social expenditures while causing it to ignore the simultaneous need to modernize the economy 
Nearly ¾ of the country’s wealth is generated by the service sector, specifically financial services and tourism 
Privatization has significantly shrunk the role of the state in the economy, including the sale of a range of assets
Welfare system has undergone substantial changes
Moving from a system that provided direct benefits to the unemployed to one that sponsors “welfare-to-work” programs emphasizing training to find employment 
The thatcher revolution helped the UK turn a corner
Until the global recession hit in 2008, the country enjoyed a decade of strong economic growth 
The neo-liberal economic policies have increased financial inequality in Europe
This inequality has a regional element
The country’s south is growing much faster than the north, which is the traditional home of heavy industry 
May’s conservative government called for building an economy that works for all citizens, not just the wealthy
Introduced programs designed to help the poor and disadvantaged, who have suffered disproportionately during the global financial crisis of the last decade and more recent economic downturn caused by Brexit
Public spending has exacerbated the gap between government revenues and government spending, a malady that Britain shares with the US and most other industrialized countries
The issue of the UK’s economic relationship with the outside world
Over past century, country grew increasingly connected to the rest of Europe → but despite its integration, the UK never accepted the euro (the common currency of the european union) and has now chosen to end its membership in the EU

Foregin relations and the world
The UK’s political future does not rest on domestic politics alone → it retains a relatively large army, has its own nuclear weapons, and boats one of the largest economies in the world
UK remains a major player in world affairs but struggles to define its place and role in a post-imperial and post-Cold War world
UK built its identity around its empire, orienting itself toward the Atlantic
UK remains willing to defend its interests militarily
After 09/11 and the Iraq war, many Britons have come to the disappointing conclusion that the US sees the UK not as a critical ally but rather as a junior partner duly expected to follow US foregin policy and provide a veneer of multilateralism no matter what the US wants to do
UK’s economic and political systems gave rise to liberalism but remain shaped by centuries-old institutions that have never been fully swept away
Its industrial strength once propelled it to empire status, though now it is overshadowed by its former colony across the atlantic and an ever-converging Europe
 Labour government anticipated that its policy of devolution would satisfy Scottish demands for greater autonomy and weaken, if not silence, the movement for independence
They controlled the devolved scottish government from 1998-2007
2020 passage of Brexit has reinvigorated the pro-independence Scottish activists and reignited calls for a second referendum  

The EU
In aftermath of WWII, a number of european leaders argued that repeated conflicts in the region were caused by a lack of interconnection between countries
This frosted insecurity, inequality, and nationalism
Argued that a common political agenda would give european states greater international authority in a postwar environment that had been dominated by Soviet union and US
European Commission
Body made up of 27 members, each responsible for some specific policy area
Has its own president - serves 5 year term
European Parliament
A legislature whose 705 members are directly elected by the EU member states for 5-year terms
Parliament passes legislation proposed by the commission 
EU court of justice 
Made up of one judge for each country
Rules on EU laws and conflicts between EU laws and the laws of member states
Intergovernmental system → similar to the UN, a system whose member countries cooperate on issues but may not be bound by the organization’s resolutions
Supranational system → a system where sovereignty is shared between the member states
What EU now looked like
Can be argued that the EU itself is not a source of democratic values
Driven by bureaucrats who were unaccountable to their citizens
On Jan 1, 1999, the majority of EU member states linked their currencies to the euro, a single currency, under the control of the European Central Bank
Would allow for one measure of prices and values across the EU, increasing competition by stimulating trade and cross-border investment within the EU
Not all countries chose to adopt the euro → UK, Denmark, and Sweden all opted out
In some ways the EU has been a victim of its own success
Integration not only prevented conflict in Europe but also laid the foundation for economic development and prosperity across the continent and institutionalized democracy in countries that had never experienced it

Devolution and Democracy
Devolution is also shaping how developed democracies manage their sovereignty
Devolution = process of transferring powers and resources away from central state institutions and vesting them at a lower level
Devolution reverses the historical development of the state, which is noteworthy for its centralization of power over time
Devolution is seen as a way to counteract the distrust of the state by bringing government closer to the public, thereby increasing local control and participation
Devolution can also help give voice to marginal communities, such as ethnic minorities, by giving them greater control over local affairs
One way devolution can take place is through the transfer of responsibility and funds to local authorities, giving them greater say in how policies are crafted and executed 
Another way to effort devolution is by creating wholly new political institutions to provide a greater level of public participation

Means of Devolution
Transfer of policy-making responsibility to lower levels of government
Creation of new political institutions at lower levels of government
Transfer of funds and taxation power to lower levels of government, affording them more control over how resources are distributed

Brexit
UK was in the late warming to the idea of the EU, initially skeptical of its membership and then later kept out by the French
To many Britons the notion of participating in a stronger EU was simply unacceptable, fearing the regional economic union would become an unwieldy superstate, undermining national sovereignty, draining the domestic budget, and imposing continental values
UK’s unwillingness to accept the euro furthered evidence of their skepticism
Britain's position vis-á-vis Europe over the past few decades remained controversial and ambivalent 
Prime Minister Cameron sought to shore up support within his own party by promising in 2013 that if the Tories were to win an outright majority in the 2015 parliamentary elections, the government would hold a national referendum on British membership in the EU
After his win, Cameron promised that his government would first negotiate new agreements with the EU and then hold a simple “in-or-out” referendum on Britain's EU membership by the end of 2017
In 2016, Cameron negotiated concessions from the EU that exempted Britain from obligations for member countries to pursue greater political integration and provide limited welfare and employment benefits to migrants
When Britain voted in a narrow majority to leave the EU, Cameron resigned and Thersea May took over 
She quickly formed her cabinet, appointing outspoken “Leave” proponent Boris Johnson as foregin secretary
All major political parties (other than Tories) had joined Cameron in supporting the failed “Remain” campaign, most vocally the majority SNP in Scotland and Sinn Féin in Northern Ireland
In March of 2017, May’s government invoked Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union, formally notifying the EU of Britain's plans to withdraw and officially launching the 2-year negotiation process to leave the trading bloc
May was replaced by Johnson, who filled his cabinet with Brexiteers
Johnson hammered out a Brexit deal with a revised backstop, which was approved by both Parliament and the EU in early 2020

UNIT 3: MEXICO
Caciques
Caciques are local military strongmen in Mexico
With the end of spanish rule and the strong central government of the viceroy, Mexico came to be dominated by local military strongmen, known as caciques
Independent Mexico’s first leader =  Colonel Agustín de Iturbide
had himself crowned emperor in 1822

Felipe Calderon
Successor to vicente fox
Had been involved in conservative politics his entire adult life
Calderón’s father = founder of the PAN
Was Fox’s secretary of energy, an important cabinet post in oil-rich Mexico
In office, he was a social conservative and supporter of free-market policies 

Camarillas
Camarillas = vast informal networks of personal loyalty, at the elite level
Political cliques
Were far more important than ideology
The cement of Mexican politics → personal networks or contacts to achieve successful careers in public life

Lazaro Cardenas
President of Mexico as member of PNR
Created and integrated worker and peasant organizations into the PRI structure
general in the Constitutionalist Army during the Mexican Revolution and a statesman who served as president of Mexico between 1934 and 1940
He distributed land, made loans available to peasants, organized workers’ and peasants’ confederations, and expropriated and nationalized foreign-owned industries

Caudillos
A military or political leader
Colonel Augustín de Iturbide (the first leader of independent mexico) was overthrown by General Antonio Lopex de Santa Anna, mexico’s first in a series of Caudillos

Chamber of Deputies
Lower house in legislature
500 members
Has the power to pass laws, levy taxes, and verify the outcome of elections

Confederation of Mexican Workers
 

Congress
Lower house = Cámara de Diputados (federal chamber of deputies)
Upper house = senado de la republica (senate)
Bicameral legislature called the National Congress
lower house (Chamber of Deputies)
500 members
Has the power to pass laws, levy taxes, and verify the outcome of elections
upper house (Senate)
128 members
Senators from each state and an additional 32 senators selected from a national list on the basis of proportional representation
Has fewer powers than lower house
Power to confirm the president’s appointments to the supreme court
Power to approve treaties
Power to approve federal intervention in state matters
Currently in transition 
Until 1988, the PRI regularly won over 90% of lower house seats and never lost a senate seat
In 1997, two main opposition parties were able to form a coalition and take control of the lower house
Before 1997, lower house approved about 98% of the legislation submitted by the executive, but that percentage has fallen steadily since then

Constitution of 1917
A separation of judicial, legislative, and executive power
A system of federalism that at least formally gives mexico’s states considerable power
The 71-year domination of the political system by the PRI, however, rendered this formidable constitution largely meaningless
One important set of reforms, passed in 1977, changed the electoral law (implementing some element of proportional representation, or PR) to guarantee the presence of the opposition in the legislature
Other reforms passed under the past PRI prescient before democratization, Ernesto Zedeillo, gave the legislature control of judicial appointments and imposed electoral safeguards that greatly reduced the ability of a government to steal an election

Criollos
mexican-born descendents of the spanish colonists
The struggle for independence can viewed as a conflict over control of the state between the aristocracy loyal to spain and the increasingly powerful and wealthy criollos

Porfirio Diaz
From 1876-1910, mexican politics was dominated by Porfirio Díaz
He had backed the liberal reforms of juarez and fought to expel the french imposed monarchy but then embraced conservtive ideas to gain the support of elites and maintain power
He imposed a brutal authoritarian regimes and gave mexico its first taste of sustainability since independence

Federal District of Mexico City
The seat of the national government
It is officially equivalent with Mexico City, although the Mexico City metropolitan area extends beyond the district's boundaries
Administrative district 

Federal Electoral Institute
During last 2 decades election were widely seen as corrupt
1988 election more than 30,000 ballots disappeared
Only in 1996 did the PRI succumb to pressure and create a truly independent Federal Electorate Institute
Also created the federal electoral tribunal to adjudicate all electoral disputes
Federal electoral institute took power away from the government-controlled secretary of government
An autonomous, public organization responsible for organizing federal elections in Mexico, that is, those related to presidents of the United Mexican States, the members of the Congress of the Union as well as elections of authorities and representatives at local and state levels

Vicente Fox
PAN leader (did not share much of the social conservatism that is typical of many PAN leaders)
His roots were in business and later he became active in local government, having served as governor of his home state after a stint in congress
Once in office, Fox formed a cabinet that included no members of the PAN’s more conservative “traditionalist” wing, and his closest advisors were nonPAN members
Fox had trouble delivering in office
He passed a transparency law to facilitate public oversight of government, and he restructured and purged Mexico’s powerful corruption-riddled Federal Judicial Police
He passed legislation to allow 10 million Mexicans living abroad to vote in elections
His successes were outweighed by numerous policy failures, due largely to his inability to work with the opposition-dominated legislature as well as the opposition within his own party
Failed to end Zapatista rebellion in Chiapas
Unable to pass a badly needed tax increase to raise revenue for social spending and other public investment
Had a disappointing record on rooting out government corruption 
Successor = Calderón

Immigration Reform and Control Act
Imposed sanctions on employers of undocumented immigratns and toughened the enforcement of immigration laws
It provided amnesty for longtime undocumented workers and legalized about 2.3 milluon mexican immigrants
It was a result of the dramatic growth of undocumented mexico immigrants especailly after the economic crisis in mexico during the 1980s, became a political crisis in the US during 1980s-1990s

Import Substitution Industrialization
1917-1980, leaders of PRI agreed on some main features of the mexican economy 
Mexico’s industrialization would be encouraged through import substitution industrialization (ISI) policies
ISI = employed high tariffs to protect mexican industries and agriculture

Informal Economy/Sector
The informal economy includes wage earners that do not have access to social security and self employed workers that do not follow a formal accounting system
The tremendous size and importance of the informal sector = indicator of the degree of inequality in Mexico
It is estimated that well over ¼ of the labor force is employed in the underground economy as informal vendors of goods and services, producing 13% of mexico’s GDP

Latifundistas
Latifundistas = large landowners
The power of latifundistas grew with independence, and the newly independent mexico became more unequal and politically unstable

Jose Lopez Portillo
Essentially decreed the nationalization of Mexico’s banking system
Associated with the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI)
Only official candidate in the 1976 Presidential election, being the only President in recent Mexican history to win an election unopposed
last of the so-called economic nationalist Mexican presidents

Maquiladoras
Factories that import materials or parts to make goods that are then exported
Maquiladoras have added half a million jobs to Mexico’s north, but some critics argue that the operations add relatively little to the Mexican economy because most materials and technology are imported
Mexico’s entry into NAFTA attracted more direct US investment in Mexico, specifically towards maquiladoras
These factors, contracted along US-Mexico border, account for about half of all Mexico’s exports

Maya
Located in far south of Mexico
When spanish conquistador Hernán Cortés arrived in Mexico in 1519, he encountered well-established and highly sophisticated indigenous civilizations
Country has been home to maya, aztecs, and toltecs
Mayas there before europeans arrived
War of the Castes
the revolt of Native Maya people of the Yucatán Peninsula against Hispanic populations 
Hispanic populations had long held political and economic control of the region

Mestizos
people of mixed spanish and indigienous heritage
60% of the population
Emilio Zapata = mesitzo 
mestizo middle class professionals who had suffered under diaz dictatorship wrote the constitution of 1917
Many lived in poverty
​​Mexico’s independence did nothing to alleviate the poverty of mexico’s indigineous people and its large mestizo population

Mexican-American War
Fought primarily on Mexican soil 
1840, US defeated Mexico and claimed half of Mexico’s territory (present-day AZ, CA, CO, NV, NM, TX, and UT)
In the aftermath of the defeat, Mexico’s weakened government faced a massive uprising, known as the War of the Castes, by the indigienous Mayan population in the South

Mexican Miracle
The country's inward-looking development strategy that produced sustained economic growth
considered to be a golden age of capitalism in Mexican economics in which the Mexican economy grew 4% each year
1940s economic plan (known as mexican miracle) was rolled out
Economic boom = 1954-1970

Mexican Revolution
1910-1917
A struggle between two groups attempting to seize control of the state
First group = middle class mexicans who resisted the dictatorship of Díaz and wanted a more democratic political system with a capitalist economy 
Second group = radical social reformers who proposed, among other things, agrarian reform 
In the first phase of the revolution, middle class political reformers, led by landowner Fransico Maderno, defeated the diaz dictatorship
Most famous revolutionary reformers advocate for the poor was Emilio Zapata, a young mestizo peastent leader
He organized a peasant army in Morelos, south of Mexico city, to push for agrarian reform 
In north mexico, Francisco (pancho) villa organized an army of peasant and small farmers
Order was restored in 1917, under the leadership of northern governor, Venustiano Carranza

Mexico’s War of Independence
extremely violent
lasted 11 years
cost over half a million lives
Between the aristocracy loyal to spain and the increasingly powerful and wealthy criollos
Criollos = mexican-born descendents of the spanish colonists
When spain adopted a progressive-liberal constitution in 1812, conservative mexico elites accepted independence as the only means to preserve order and status quo
Leading rebels and political conservatives agree that an independent mexico, declared in 1821, would preserve the role of the Catholic Church and implement a constitutional monarchy with a European at the head
Mexico’s independence did nothing to alleviate the poverty of mexico’s indigineous people and its large mestizo population

Municipios
a local civil administrative subdivision recognized by the national government
States are subdivided into municipios (similar in some ways to county governments in the US)

Nahuatl
Concentrated in central mexico
native to southern Mexico and Central America, including the Aztecs
Speak native language
30% living primarily in central and southern parts of the country, are considered indigineous because they speak the indigineous language
Largest 2 groups = mayans and nahuatls

NAFTA
drastically reduced most tariffs on agricultural goods traded among Mexico, Canada, and the US
Between 1993-2012, trade between the US and Mexico increased by 500%
Doubled the amount of food Mexico imports from the US, lowering food prices for consumers
Created a massive crisis for million of Mexico’s farmers
eliminated millions of jobs in agriculture due to importation
exacerbated the gap between the wealthy north and impoverished south
However….
Manufacturing exports to US have skyrocketed, growing at an average rate of 75% annually since the agreement went into effect
Mexican exports rose sevenfold between 1994-2011
Greater access to US markets has also been a boon to mexico’s fruit and vegetable producers, who now supply much of the US winter market, although exports of agricultural goods have grown very modesty compared with those of manufactured goods
diversified Mexico’s economy
1980s, oil made up about ⅔ of exports → now exports a wide variety of goods, but it remains extremely dependent on US market, to which it sends over 80% of exports
Mexico’s entry into NAFTA attracted more direct US investment in Mexico
NAFTA dislodged millions of mexicans, creating new political and economic challenges for future mexican administrations
In october 2018, under pressure from Donald Trump, Mexico, US, and Canada signed new free trade agreement to replace NAFTA
The United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) is generally similar to NAFTA, but it further reduces some tariffs (on dairy, for ex), requires that a higher percentage of products be produced in North America, and requires duty-free goods to be produced by workers making a higher hourly wage

PAN
Founded 1939
Right of center party - a conservative political party 
Party from the North
More about trade
Causes that led PAN to take the 2000 election - Vicente Fox
Voter fraud/rigged elections
Changes in policy that allowed the opposition to have seats in the government
1980s and 1990s = massive economic crisis and major split in PRI party
Voters started losing trust in PRI party
Close ties to roman catholic church
It generally supports minimal government intervention in the economy.
Formed to represent the interests of business and of the Roman Catholic Church
Largely supported by urban middle class and in the northern parts of the country

PRD
Emerged in 1990s
Party of the south
Party to the left
Land redistribution
Zapata = wanted land reform because the government took all the land from indiginous and sold it to wealthy elite (another radical left party)
Cárdenas and  Porfirio Muñoz Ledo (a a former president of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI)) were key founders
Stands on a populist, prostatist platform
In addition to its opposition to many of the government's economic liberalization reforms, it has been the most vociferous advocate of political competition pluralization prior to the critical 2000 presidential campaign
Recruits its leadership from the working class
It has the smallest partisan support and is the least well-represented at the state level

PRI
Founded 1929
Originally called the National Revolutionary Party
Founded in a period of conflict with the Roman Catholic Church, rebellion in the military, and disputes with the United States
 the party represented the institutionalization of the new power structure that had emerged as a result of the Mexican Revolution (1910–20), a coalition of regional and local political-military bosses and labour and peasant leaders
Sought more conservative evolution and stability in government 
Center left party
only national party
PRI dominated elections for a long time
Under PRI did have elections but just transitioning next PRI into power
A lot of election fraud
Since the revolution, up until the year 2000, not a good grade for competitive elections
PRI allow for other party to exist and other parties to have some seats, but not that legitimate  in terms of president and successor chosen by president
Allowed other parties to exist but if they look at all threatening, someone gets poisoned in a literal sense
Allowed to exist for the veneer of legitimacy
Patron-Client Relationships
Powerful government officials delivered state services and access to power in exchange for political support
Operated from the top of the hierarchy, dominated by the PRI-controlled presidency, down to the very poorest segments of society

PEMEX
Cardénas  integrated peasants and workers into state-controlled union, he strengthened the mexican state by nationalized the foregin-dominated oil industry and created a state oil monopoly (PEMEX)
Has played an important role in mexico’s economy 
It is mexico’s biggest company and its biggest source of tax revenue 
PEMEX has been losing money in part because it lacks the capital and expertise to explore deepwater oil reserves in the Gulf of Mexico, so oil production has steadily declined
When Obrador came to power he put a brake on foregin investment in the energy sector, and he pledged to invest heavily in PEMEX to boost production, but skeptics argued that without foregin investment and technology, Mexico will be unable to increase oil production 

Sec. of Government
Controls internal political affairs
One of the two highest profile cabinet posts and have often been stepping stones to the presidency
 In 1996 =the PRI created a truly independent Federal Electorate Institute, taking power away from the government-controlled secretary of government

Sec. of Treasury
Oversees the economy
One of the two highest profile cabinet posts and have often been stepping stones to the presidency

Senate
Upper house in legislature
128 members
Senators from each state and an additional 32 senators selected from a national list on the basis of proportional representation
Has fewer powers than lower house
Power to confirm the president’s appointments to the supreme court
Power to approve treaties
Power to approve federal intervention in state matters

Supreme Court
Chief judicial body
11 supreme country justices are appointed by the president and are confirmed by a ⅔ vote of the senate - limited to 15 year terms
during the authoritarian period the supreme court never overturned any law, and it tended to view its jurisdiction in very limited terms
Supreme court can now determine the constitutionality of legislation on the request of 1/3 of the lower house, but it can strike down a law only if a supermajority of 8 judges agrees

Televista

War of the Castes
1847-1901
the revolt of Native Maya people of the Yucatán Peninsula against Hispanic populations 
Hispanic populations had long held political and economic control of the region

Emiliano Zapata
Most famous revolutionary reformers advocate for the poor
 a young mestizo peastent leader
He organized a peasant army in Morelos, south of Mexico city, to push for agrarian reform 
January 1, 1994 a rebel army made up of mostly ethnic mayans, the Zapatista Army of National Liberation (EZLN), occupied several turns in mexico's southernmost state of Chiapas
Zapatista uprising was surprisingly popular within mexico, and with the economic crisis, helped erode the PRI political dominance and accelerate electoral reforms
he strongly opposed the hacienda system that characterized much of rural Mexican life
Advocated land reform 

EZLN
Many saw EZLN as a solely indigenous group seeking greater autonomy for mexico’s long-neglected native population
Chief among EZLN’s concerns was the abrogation of article 27 of the constitution of 1917, which had mandated land reform
EZLN was reacting to the devastation caused by neoloberal trade policies that had exposed the inefficient peasant farmers to competition from cheap foregin imports
EZLN = Zapatista Army of National Liberation
Occupies several turns in Mexico’s southernmost state of Chiapas
Leader = Emilio Zapata
Also known as Zapatistas

Ernesto Zedillo
President 1994-2000
End of the PRI monopoly over presidency
Part of PRI
1996, the Zedillo government signed the San Andrés Peace Accords with the EZLN, promising the protection of indiginous languages and granting indigineous communities political autonomy

López Obrador
Current president of Mexico
Discontent about the power of big business contributed to the election of leftist López Obrador in 2018
In his first year in office, the business sector reacted favorably to to some policies of the new government
Mexican business has strongly opposed some of Obrador’s policies, especially his moratorium on foregin investment in Mexico’s oil industry 
The election of Obrador raises new questions about the state of press freedom in mexico
Obrador has a long history of tense relations with the mexican news media, and some have compared him to US president Trump in this regard
A critic of allowing foregin participation in the oil industry, mat threaten this liberalization 
Obrador put a brake on foregin investment in the energy sector, and he pledged to invest heavily in PEMEX to boost production, but skeptics argued that without foregin investment and technology, Mexico will be unable to increase oil production
Vowed to stem Mexico’s violence and rejecting a military solution to the drug wars
Instead, mexico experienced record high levels of violence in 2019 (over 9,000 people were forcefully disappeared)  
Took a non confrontational approach when Trump threatened to impose tariffs of Mexican exports unless mexico took action to stem the flow of central americans seeking asylum in the US

UNIT 4: NIGERIA
Sani Abacha
Second in command to Babangida
Took power when Babangida stepped down
Abacha’s government lacked many of the skilled that had allowed Babangida to remain in power for such a long period of time
While Babangida sought to co-opt his opponents as much as possible,. Using force only as a last resort, Abacha regularly employed violence as means of public control
The writer and environmentalist, Ken Saro-Wiwa, a critic of the regime and of the Shell Oil Company’s role in Nigeria, was also arrested, and later executed, for his opposition to the regime
Hsi execution led to Nigeria’s expulsion form the Commonwealth of Nations and the imposing of sanctions by the US and the EU
Not only did Abacha repress the nigerian people, he also stole around $6 billion from the state
By Abacha’s government, corruption had reached an all-time high
Economy suffered from the outright theft of state and became a center for illicit activity, including narcotics trafficking, human trafficking, money laundering, and the 419 or advance fee-scams
Abacha’s repressive regime froze much of the push for Sharia law, but revived with onset of civilian rule
Nigeria’s international relations declined steadily under Sani Abacha and by 1995 the country had been suspended from the Commonwealth and subjected sanctions by the european union and the US following the execution of Saro-Wiwa

Ibrahim Babangida
Babangida, an ethinci Gbagyi and muslim, had the inevitable take of dealing with Nigeria’s mounting economic crisis 
Backed by IMF and world bank, he implemented a neoliberal structural adjustment program that made drastic cuts in public spending and dramatically worsened the lives if average nigerians 
In 1980s, he sought to initiate a civilian transition under his control, even to the point of creating new political parties and platforms
Under growing public pressure, presidential election for this third republic were held in 1993, but Babngida quicly annulled results
Led to a wave of unrest, so he stepped down, and Sani Abacha, his second in command, took power
Overthrew Buhard in 1985
Babangida sought to co-opt his opponents as much as possible
Decline in oil prices in 1980s and the consequent economic crisis and spiraling foregin debt led nigeria to initiate a policy of neoliberal structural adjustment that moved the country away from import substitution
When public suffered from effect of structural adjustment, such as unemployment and inflation, the Babangida regime used its financial resources to co-opt some opponents while repressing others
Economic reforms only facilitated this patronage, bc new liberalized markets and privatized state assets could be doled out in return for political support

Derivation Formula
The expansion of oil revenues has led to increased disputes over the national distribution of these funds - known as the derivation formula - and the percentage of revenues that should accrue to the oil-producing localities
Oil producing states and other southern states have called for greater autonomy and clamored the loudest for greater devolution of central authority and fiscal restructuring

Federal Character Principle
The quota system, referred to as the federal character principle, is also used with federal appointments and civil service positions in the government bureaucracy
Each ethnic group is alloted a certain portion of federal positions based on its regional population
the appointments of government personnel into any Federal establishment or agency or as a minister is to be done to reflect the federal Character.

First Republic
October 1, 1960 = independence, creating the First Republic
The First Republic was the republican government of Nigeria between 1963 and 1966 governed by the first republican constitution
Parliamentary system that was modeled off of british colonialism 
Because they wanted to distance themselves from their colonial colonizers
Not modeling themselves over their oppressors 

Fourth Republic
current

Boko Haram
Ethinic insurgencies and communal clashes include land disputes between northern muslims herders and southern christian farmers in the middle of the country, separatist sentiments in the southeast, armed bandits in the northwest, competing militias in the oil-rich south, and the rise of an islamist insurgency in the northeast assosiated with the terriorist organization Boko Haram
the growing insurgency of Boko Haram will exacerbate the long-standing conflict between northern and southern Nigeria and embroil the country in the regional and global struggles against violent Islamic extremist 
Niergia’s weak capacity and longstanding ethnic and relgions tensions have made the country a values regional platform for terrorist activity
Boko Haram opposes the Westernization of Nigerian society, which it blames for "Nigeria's culture of corruption", and demands the establishment of an Islamic state in Nigeria. It developed into a jihadist group in 2009

Fulani
Ethnic group that is overwhelmingly Muslim and concentrated in the north

Hausa
Ethnic group, similar to fulani, is overwhelmingly Muslin and concentrated in the north
Current president = Muhammadu Buhari
A former general and northern Hausa muslim

House of Reps
Contains 360 seats
Each member represents an individual district
Lower house of legislature
All 360 seats in the House of Representatives are contested in single-member districts apportioned roughly equally by population

Igbo
Dominated the east
Each group has temptations to see politics in zero-sum terms, leaving to problems for the consolidation of democracy
Even zonings’s rotation of officeholders from the north and south is seen to exclude the interests of the southeastern Igbo and other smaller ethnic minorities
Such ethnic divisions were largely responsible for the collapse of civilian government in 1966 and the Nigeria Civil War

Goodluck Jonathan
An ethinic Ijaw Christian from southern Nigeria, who first assumed the presidency in 2010 after President Umaru Yar’Adua died in office
A southern christian
Initially a caretaker until the 2011 election would permit the PDP’s northern political bosses to resume their “turn” in the rotating zoning system
Promised to tackle the biggest problems
Rigged elections
Woefully inadequate electricity
Insurgency in his native Niger Delta
Sacked the head of the election commissions (who was very corrupt) and replaced him with an impeccably honest academic
Successor to Umaru Yar'Adua

Muhammadu Buhari
Elected in 2015 on the promise of fighting corruption, boosting the economy, and improving national security, Buhari had little to show for his 4 years in office
Corruption worsened during his term
Plummeting oil prices pushed Nigeria into recession
Political violence increased across much of the country
Buhari spent nearly ⅓ of his first term outside of the country seeking undisclosed medical care
Buhari still win 2019 election for APC
APC also took nearly ⅔ seats in the senate and house of representatives and captured over ½ the governorships
Buhari earned over half the popular vote, but won few of the southernmost states
Current president = Muhammadu Buhari
6th democratically elected executive to govern nigeria and the first to defeat an incumbent in a democratic election
A former general and northern Hausa muslim
First came to power in a military coup in 1983 and rule Nigeria with an iron fist before being ousted in another coup in 1985
During his 20 month rule, he arrested hundreds of corrupt officials and businessmen, executive drug dealers, and expelled thousands of illegal immigrants
He was elected president in 2015 as a self-avowed democrat, having completed unsuccessfully in three previous presidential elections
He replaced Goodluck Jonathan, an ethinic Ijaw Christian from southern Nigeria, who first assumed the presidency in 2010 after President Umaru Yar’Adua died in office

MEND
The Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta (MEND), an umbrella organization that claims to act on behalf of the Delta’s oppressed peoples and exploited environment

MOSOP
The Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People (MOSOP), established by Ken Saro-Wiwa in the 1990s to defend the interests of the Ogoni, employed a variety of legal and extralegal political tactics to secure more financial benefits with fewer environmental costs from foregin-operated oil interests in the Niger Delta

NEEDS
Obsanjo government promised to address issues of poverty, rural infrastructure, social welfare, and youth empowerment and launched in 2003 a wide-ranging reform program known as the National Economic Empowerment and Development Strategy (NEEDS)
Sought to increase the transparency of government finances and address the corruption problem by creating an economic and financial crimes commissions to pursue theft and money laundering
Also sought to expand nigeria’s woefully inadequate infrastructure, proposing to boost electricity production, improve transportation, increase telecommunications, and expand access to sanitation and clean drinking water

Niger Delta
The oil-producing Niger Delta is home to over 40 million NIgerians who comprise more than 40 distinct ethnic groups and speak more than 250 dialects
The region produces over 2 million barrels of crude oil a day with the potential to produce up to 3 million barrels
Typically over 100,000 barrels a day are stolen by local militias and gangsters at a cost of $3 billion annually 
Nigeria’s best known region = Niger Delta
Niger river enters the sea at that point, creating a vast, swampy area of over 5,000 square miles
Third-largest wetland in the world
Host to an enormous range of plants and animals
Home to over 30 million people, who have traditionally been engaged in farming and fishing
Over a dozen groups, speaking some 25 languages inhibit the delta
Also one of the poorest regions of the country thanks to limited infrastructure and development
Niger delta is also the source of Nigeria’s oil, which in most years comprises over 90% of the country’s exports

Olusegun Obasanjo
In 1999, free presidential elections were held, bringing Obasanjo to power again as the first head of the state in the current democratic fourth republic
Scholars have offered a number of explanations for the military’s nonintervention in the fourth republic
They point to President Obasanjo’s legislation in the early 2000s requiring the retirement of all military officers who previously held political offices during the period of military rule
Also note the government’s seizure of senior military officers’ corruptly acquired money and properties and the growing professionalization of the younger cohorts of officers 
Obasanjo has been described as one of the great figures of the second generation of post-colonial African leaders. He received praise both for overseeing Nigeria's transition to representative democracy in the 1970s and for his Pan-African efforts to encourage cooperation across the continent

Patrimonialism
The most prominent form of governance in independent Nigeria has been patrimonialism, in which personal rule by both authoritarian and democratic leaders has been shored up by the economic privileges those leaders bestow on a coterie of loyal followers
The divisiveness, corruption, and illegitimacy of patrimonialism have meant that the bullet of military coups, rather than the ballots of electoral democracy, have too often determined Nigerian regime shifts and changes in government
Each new regime has come to power promising improved governance, and each has largely failed to deliver on this promise

PDP
People’s Democratic Party (PDP)
Representing northern Hausa 
5 next elections have shown growing democracy and declining regional basis for party affiliation, but have continued patterns of electoral corruption and (until most recent 2 elections) PDP dominance
PDP leaders established an informal system of presidential rotations known as zoning, in which the party would alternate every 2 terms (8 years) in nominating candidates from the north and south
This limited the pool of qualified candidates and exacerbated the ethnic divisions by framing issues and policy priorities in terms of alternating regions and religions

Biafra (Biafra War)
In may 1967, the Igbo-dominated eastern region seceded from Nigeria, declaring itself the Republic of Biafra
Although the Biafrans were outnumbered and outgunned, they held the nigerian military off for 3 years, aided in part by international supporters who believed the Nigerian government was conducting a genocidal war against the Igbo
Azikiwe was an Igbo and became a prominent support of Biafra independence
Biafra War = a civil war fought between the government of Nigeria and the Republic of Biafra, a secessionist state which had declared its independence from Nigeria in 1967. Nigeria was led by General Yakubu Gowon, while Biafra was led by Lt. Colonel Odumegwu Ojukwu
Result = Nigerian victory: Dissolution of the Republic of Biafra Rise and continuation of Igbo nationalism and Biafra joined Nigeria in territory

Resource Curse
Nigeria’s problem is an example of the resource curse
Natural resources that are abundant and state-controlled often serve to support nondemocratic rule
Rather than being responsible to a public that it depends on for tax revenues, these ruling regimes can employ state controlled resources to co-opt or buy stakeholders and pay for the repression of others
Nigeria = a petrostate that combines a perfect storm of contentious politics, a massively corrupt and ineffective system of fiscal federalism and robust state deficits and dysfunction

Ken Saro-Wiwa
Established The Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People (MOSOP)
A Nigerian writer, television producer, and environmental activist

“Scramble for Africa”/ European Imperialism
 Berlin conference
European scramble for land
Influence for colonies gobbles up the continent

Second Republic
Collapsed quickly due to rules and norms due to military 
Military coups end them
Presidential system 

Sharia Law
The sectarian division has exacerbated by the growing influence of Sharia law in the northern states
Under british rule, Islamic law was preserved in the north, where it was permitted an important if limited role
Practice continues under independent nigeria, and by 1980s islamics groups had begun pressuring the government to allow for the expansion of sharia in the north to criminal law and higher courts, where it then had no authority 
Abacha’s repressive regime froze much of that action, but revived with onset of civilian rule
Muslim leaders and public saw the expansion of sharia as a way to overcome the corruption of the military era and reassert their rights in a democratic system
Shortly after 1999 elections, a dozen northern states made sharia the primary law, extending it to criminal and other matters
Included extreme punishment for adultery and apostasy (leaving the faith) with death by stoning
Sharia touched off some of the worst violence under civilian rule
Tension over sharia also grabbed international attention when 2 women were sentenced to be stoned to death for committing adultery

Third Republic
Military coup ended it
collapsed


Zoning
PDP leaders established an informal system of presidential rotations known as zoning, in which the party would alternate every 2 terms (8 years) in nominating candidates from the north and south
This limited the pool of qualified candidates and exacerbated the ethnic divisions by framing issues and policy priorities in terms of alternating regions and religions

Rent-Seeking
the effort to increase one's share of existing wealth without creating new wealth.
Rent-seeking activities aim to obtain financial gains and benefits through the manipulation of the distribution of economic resources
Biggest example = oil
Oil is privatized by shell company in nigeria
Oil is state - owned in mexico

RUSSIA
Asymmetric Federalism
a system in which power is devolved unequally across the country and its constituent regions, often because of specific laws negotiated between a region and the central government 

Chechnya
With the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, the various republics broke off to form independent states
Chechnya, was not a republic in its own right, but the people believe it should have the right of independence
The conflict eventually led to outright war between russian military forces and Chechen rebels
1990s, an uneasy peace allowed Chechnyta to function as a de facto independent country  
Domestic terrorism has decline over the past 5 years, facilitated by an extremly repressive rule in Chechnya

Cheka
A secret police force
Formed to root out opposition
Later became KGB, the body that would control domestic dissent and supervise overseas surveillance

Commonwealth of independent States
Consistent with its role in Ukraine, as Russia’s relationship with the West had soured it has sought to rebuild its own sphere of influence
In 1991, it helped create the commonwealth of independent states (CIS), a loosely integrated body that incorporated many former soviet republics
CIS has little formal power, but russia has used it to coordinate its relationsjip with a number of former soviet republics

Communist Party of the Russian Federation (CPRF)
Before the rise of united russia, the strongest and most institutionalized party was the communist party of the russian federation (CPRF), successor of the soviet-era organization
Though banned by Yeltsin in 1991, the party was allowed to reorganize in 1993 and draws support from a portion of the population that is ambivalent about or hostile to the political and economic changes that have taken place since the 1980s
1995 elections, CPRF reached its peak, becoming the largest single party in the Duma and raising the fear among many that the country would return to communist rule
CPRF differs from most other postcommunist parties in eastern europe, many of which broke decisively from their communist past in the 1990s and successfully recast themselves as social-democratic organizations
CPRF remains close to its communist ideology and rejects western capitalism and globalization
Also embraces the stalinist period and has called for the return of the country to stalinist ideals
CPRF criticizes the government and united russia but is careful not to attack Putin
As the russian population ages, the CPRF is losing its traditional base
As second largest party, it enjoys protest votes from those opposed to united russia, particularly those who have suffered from the economic changes that have emerged since the end of the soviet union 

Constitutional Court
Chief judicial body
No constitutional court existed until 1991
At the top of the russia legal structure is the constitutional court
First developed under Gorbechev’s reforms in the late Soviet era, the court has 19 members who are nominated by the president and confirmed by the federation council
The court is empower to rule of such matters as international treaties, relations between branches of government, violations of civil rights, and impeachment of the president
Has the power of both abstract review (the ability to rule on constitutional issues even when a case has not been brought before it) and concrete review (the ability to rule on specific cases)
One role the court does not play is that of a court of last appeal for criminal cases
This is the responsibility of the supreme court

Duma
Lower house in the legislature
may reject the president’s nominee, but if it does so 3 times, the president must dissolve the duma and call for new elections
450 seats
Members of the duma, the more powerful of the 2 houses, serve 5 year terms
Duma has he right to initiate and accept or reject legislation and may override the president’s veto with a ⅔ vote
Duma approves the appointment of the pm, though repeated rejections can lead to the duma’s dissolution
Duma can call a vote of no confidence in opposition to the pm and his government
Should a no-confidence vote pass, the president may simply ignore the decision
If a second vote happens within three months, the president is obliged to dismiss the pm and cabinet or call for new duma elections
Duma’s opposition to the PM could lead to its own dissolution 
Under the right circumstances, could lead to elections that strengthen the position of parties that oppose the current leadership
Another area where the duma can theoretically wield power is in the drafting of legislation

Eurasian Union
Putin called for the creation of a Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU) for economic and political integration 
Called for this in one of the first announcements coinciding with his campaign to return to the presidency

Federal Security Service / KGB
manages domestic intelligence and is viewed by many as the main political actor in russia, alongside putin
Successor is chosen by the president

Federation Council
170 seats
Members of the federation council serve varied terms depending on the rules of the federal territory they represent 
Holds even less power than the state duma
Primarily serves to represent the local interests and acts as a guarantor of the constitution 
Body represents all of the 85 federal administrative units, and each unit has two representatives
Since 2002, one representative has been selected by the governor of each region and another by the regional legislature
Does not produce legislation, but it must approve bills that deal with certain issues, including taxation and the budget
If federation council rejects legislation, the duma may override the upper house with a ⅔ vote
Federation council also theoretically has the ability to impeach the president as well as to approve or reject presidential appointments to the constitutional court, declarations of war and marital law, and international treaties
Does not serve as particularly powerful institution inside the russian state

Glasnost
Initiated by Gorbechev with the twin policy of Perestroika
“openness”
encouraged public debate with the hope that a frank discussion of the system’s shortcomings would help foster change and increase the legitimacy of the regime

Insider Privatization
In many cases, businesses were not sold off to a large number of shareholders but became subject to insider privatization, which enabled the former directors of these firms to acquire the largest number of shares
refer to the transformation of formerly state-owned enterprises into joint-stock companies or private enterprises in which majority control of the enterprise is in the hands of employees and/or managers of that enterprise

Mikhail Khodorkovsky
Famous oligarch
grew rich following the opening up of the Soviet economy in 1980s by investing in such ventures as computer imports 
Later, he took advantage of the state sale of natural resources, gaining control over a large portion of the oil and gas sector
Under the putin administration, Khodorsvsky came under pressure, in part for his increasingly political activity 
In 2003 he was arrested and charged with tax evasion

Kremlin
 the president and the prime minister
Russians have referred to the executive power, whether in the form of the tsar or the general secretary, as the Kremlin
Much of the Kremlin’s power is vested in the hands of the presidency, as elaborated in the 1993 constitution
The president has numerous powers on paper
Chooses and dismissed the prime minister and other members of the cabinet
The president cannot dissolve the duma either in the year following parliamentary elections or in the last 6 months of his term
The president appoints leaders to 8 federal districts that constitute all of russia, which allows him to oversee the work of local authorities
May propose and veto bill and issue decrees - laws that do not require legislative approval, are often not made public, and may not be challenged by the citizens in the courts
Another source of power lies in the president’s control of important segment of the state
President has direct control over the foregin ministry, the defense ministry, and the interior ministry and armed forces
Controls the successor to the KGB, the Federal Security Service(FSB), which manages domestic intelligence and is viewed by many as the main political actor in russia, alongside putin
Very difficult to remove the president

Liberal Democratic Party of Russia
During the 1990s, one of the most infamous aspects of the russian party spectrum was the strength of extreme nationalism
The faction is manifested by the ill-named Liberal Democratic Party of Russia (LDPR), headed by Zhirinovsky
Espouses a rhetoric of nationalism, xenophobia, and anti-semitism, calling for such things as the reconstitution of the soviet union and exhibiting general hostility toward the west
1993 elections, many observers were shocked by the LDPRs electoral strength and its gain of 14% of the seats in the Duma
In recent elections, it has staged something of a comeback and is now the 3rd largest party in the Duma, with 40 seats
Survival of the party can be attributed to the LDPR’s consistent support for Putin and his government: indeed, many observers suspect that the LDPR was created and is supported by the government to serve as a pseudo-opposition that can be controlled

Nomenklatura
 the select list of politically influential jobs in the state, society, or economy that were controlled by the communist party
The most dangerous moment for a bad government is when it starts to reform itself
Glasnost encouraged public debate, but rather than simply criticize corruption among the nomenklatura or the quality or absence of consumer goods, people began to challenge the very nature of the political system
Perestroika had similarly unexpected effect
By seeking political and economic reform, Gorbachev threatened those within the party who had long before benefited from the status quo
Political leaders, administrators, factory bosses, and many other nomenklatura members resisted reform, taking a stance that led to infighting and instability 

Oligarchs
 a very rich business leader with a great deal of political influence
A lot of coercion went on between russian government and oligarchs

Orthodox Christianity
Another effect of the restrictions of civil society is on religion
Although soviet-imposed atheism seriously weakened the role of religion, in recent years Orthodox Christianity has begun to reclaim a role in public life
Other religious movements, ranging from Islam to Buddhism to vangelical Christianity, also have emerged or reemerged

Parties of Power
Perestroika
Initiated by Gorbechev with glasnost
Perestroika, or actual institutional reforms in the economy and political system, would flow from this critique
These reforms were expected to include some limited forms of democratic participation and market-based incentives in the economy 
Had unexpected effects
By seeking political and economic reform, Gorbachev threatened those within the party who had long before benefited from the status quo
Political leaders, administrators, factory bosses, and many other nomenklatura members resisted reform, taking a stance that led to infighting and instability 

Politburo
the principal policy making committee of a communist party

Vladimir Putin
Current president of Russia
Rules russia in a dictatorship under communist party
Lots of corruption in the government
One of putin’s first steps was to act against the oligarchs and divest them of power
Using a variety of tools, he stripped them of their assets, many of which they had gained under the loans-for-shares scheme
Served 2 terms and then ran again in 2012
Putin returned to presidency in 2012 as a surprise to many who hoped that he would remain in a secondary position of power, and it is widely assumed that Medvedev stepped down at Putin’s instruction 
In the end, the role of Krelin in directing political elites from the executive down to the local level is indicative of what putin termed “the power vertical: a centralized, top-down form of political control

Right Cause
emerged on November 16, 2008 as a result of the unification of three parties that declared a liberal orientation: the Democratic Party of Russia, Civilian Power and the Union of Right Forces, for this self-disbanded

Shock Therapy
sudden and drastic measures taken to solve an intractable problem.
Looking to the lessons of Poland and action on the advice of western economic advisors, Russia opted for a course of shock therapy, rapidly dismantling central planning and freeing up prices with the hope that these actions would stimulate competition and the creation of new businesses
Immediate result = wave of hyperinflation

Soviets
Citizens of the former society union
At the same time, the US and Soviets entered a new and costly stage of the cold war, a new generation of political leaders rose to power in the soviet union
Among them was Gorbachev, who was chosen as general secretary of the communist party in 1985

Tsar/Czar
Ivan the Terrible (1547-84), who came to power in the decades following Russia’s final independence from Mogol control
Ivan began to assert Russia’s authority over that of foregin rulers and began to destroy any government institutions that obstructed his consolidation of personal power
Whatever his legacy, in Ivan’s rule we see the emergence of a single Russian emperor, or tsar, who exercised sovereignty over the nation's lands and aristocrats 
Tsar = emperor of Russia before 1917

Boris Yeltsin
In August, 1991, a group of anti reform conservatives sought to stop the disintegration of Soviet institutions by mounting a coup d’état against Gorbachev, hoping that the party-state and the military would join their ranks
After Gorbechev was under arrest, Yeltsin led resistance, famously denouncing the takeover while standing atop a tank
Yeltsin seized the opportunity to ban the communist party, effectively destroying what remained of Gorbachev's political base
As yeltsin increased reform, the parliament sought to block policies (including constitutional reform) and impeach him
In september 1993, Yeltsin responded by dissolving the parliament
Army sided with Yelstin, however, containing his opposition and suppressing the uprising with force
This support paved the way for Yelstin to write a new constitution, which was ratified in 1993
It facilitated the development of a system that emphasized presidential power
These businessmen, who came to be known as oligarchs, were noted for their control of large amounts of the Russian economy (including the media), their close ties to Yeltsin and the accusations of corruption surrounding their rise to power
The problem of the oligarchs was compounded in 1996, when the government instituted the loans-for-shares program
Strapped for cash, the Yeltsin administration chose to barrow fund form the oligarchs in return for shares in those businesses that had not yet been sold off by the state - in particular, the natural resources industry and the energy sector
Foregin investment played a very small role in the russian privatization process

Political Parties
Russia has yet to see the formation of political parties with clear ideologies and political platforms 
Over the years, multiple parties have rise and disappeared between elections for a number of reasons
The relative weakness of ideology among the public contributes to some extent
A second factor is the power of the presidency 
Largely divorced from the legislature and its party politics and standing alongside a weak prime ministerial office, the presidency has contributed to the creation of parties that largely serve one individuals’ presidential ambitions 
Steps have been taken to restrict civil society
The state has brought the mass media under federal control and increasingly is preventing independent political parties and nongovernmental organizations from functioning
Under lenin, alternative political parties and private media were banned

CHINA
Beijing Consensus
An alternative to the long-standing neoliberal free-market developmental model championed by the west and often labeled the washington consensus 
China’s continues success with its version of state-led capitalism has led some to label this neomercantilism development model the “Beijing Consensus”
the political and economic policies of the People's Republic of China that began to be instituted by Deng Xiaoping after Mao Zedong's death in 1976

CCP
Chinese Communist Party
China rules on this dominant party

Confucianism
The philosophy of confucianism influenced the imperial leaders with its emphasis on a fixed set of hierarchical roles, meritocracy, and obedience to authority 
Confucianism also helped foster the development of the chinese civil service, a corps of educated men chosen on the basis of a rigorous series of competitive examinations testing their familitary with confucian thought 
One significant influence over the political culture and ideology of the chinese people has been the teachings of the scholar confucius
Mao launched his 1960s cultural revolution with the explicit intent of destroying the institutional legacies of confucianism
In the moral vacuum resulting from the waning influence of communist ideology in recent decades, the post-Mao chinese communist leadership has embraced key elements of confucian philosophy
Under the tenets of confucianism, the role of government is to impose a strict moral code and foster correct behavior
Central to confucian worldview are the ideas of hierarchy and social harmony 
Peace, order, and stability in both the family and the nation flow from the proper actions of benevolent superiors and obedient inferiors who all known their rightful place in society and act accordingly 

Cultural Revolution
1966 Mao launched the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution 
The persecution unleashed during the next decade targeted those with the most expertise, and the impact on the education system and the economy was devastating 
Following several years of utter chaos in which schools were closed and many factories shut down, Mao’s disastrous policies were shelved 
The chaos of the cultural revolution left china a poor and isolated economy 
Things started to improve w/ Mao's death 

Danwei
Mao and the party-state ensured control through the danwei (work unit) system, which gave all urban-dwelling chinese citizens a lifetime affiliation with a specific industrial, agricultural, or bureaucratic work unit that dictated all aspects of their lives (family size, housing, daily food rations, health care, etc.) 

Falun Gong
A decade following the crushing of the student movement at Tiananmen Square, the party-state launched a repression campaign against practitioners of the meditative martial arts movement Falun Gong
This martial art was initially promoted by the party-state as a safe domestic alternative to potentially threatening western social and religious movements - but as movement grew, it caught the attention of the state, which began to impose restrictions
Despite the persecution, Falun Gong still claims millions of followers
a set of meditation exercises and texts that preach the virtues of truth, benevolence and forbearance

Floating Population
Among other consequences of the relaxation of the party-state’s institutions of social control, China today has a floating population of nearly 300 million itinerant workers who have abandoned their rural hukou destination to seek employment in cities
a terminology used to describe a group of people who reside in a given population for a certain amount of time and for various reasons, but are not generally considered part of the official census count

Great Leap Forward
Mao and the CCP sought to rapidly industrialize China by launching a crash industrialization campaign called the Great Leap Forward (1958-60)
Mao believed that China’s communist-led masses could be harnesses to carry out rapid industrial growth 
To pursue that goal, he favored a policy of Reds versus experts - setting politically indoctrained party cadres (Reds) over those with economic training (experts)
The Great Leap forward also collectivized agriculture by creating gigantic communes that became party-controlled providers of education, health care, public works, and industrial production 
However, the great leap forward was a failure 
The diversion of energy from agriculture to inefficient industry and a drop in food production caused by the forced collectivization of farm production were largely responsible for a 3-year famine that killed tens of millions of chinese people 
By early 1960s, Mao had been marginalized from the realm of economic policy making, and most of his great leap forward policies has been abandoned

Harmonious Society
The Harmonious Society is a socioeconomic concept in China that is recognized as a response to the increasing alleged social injustice and inequality emerging in mainland Chinese society as a result of unchecked economic growth, which has led to social conflict

Propaganda 
information, especially of a biased or misleading nature, used to promote or publicize a particular political cause or point of view

Household Responsibility System
Agricultural communes were disbanded and gradually replaced with the household responsibility system - a euphemism for largely private farming 
Individual farmers still have to sell a set amount of their produce to the state, but they were free to sell any surplus on the open market 
Food production grew
Industries were decentralized

Hukou
Reinforced the organization placed controlled through the danwei, and tired all chinese to a particular geographical location
Among other consequences of the relaxation of the party-state’s institutions of social control, China today has a floating population of nearly 300 million itinerant workers who have abandoned their rural hukou destination to seek employment in cities

Hundred Flowers Campaign
Mao's Hundred Flowers Campaign of 1956  encouraged public criticism and dissent, though it soon ended, and the most prominent critics were purged from their positions of authority in the subsequent anti-rightist campaign 
a period from 1956 to 1957 in the People's Republic of China during which the Chinese Communist Party encouraged citizens to openly express their opinions of the Communist Party

Iron Rice Bowl
CCP promised all chinese an iron rice bowl (lifetime employment, health care, and retirement security) and retained state ownership of all property and full control of the economy through central planning 
State bureaucrats assigned targets and quotas to producers at all levels of the economy and allocated basic goods to consumers 
Mao’s iron rice bowl gave way to labor mobility, job uncertainty, and in many cases unemployment
refers to an occupation with guaranteed job security, as well as steady income and benefits. The Chinese term can be compared to the similar English concept of a "job for life"

Xi Jinping

Hu Jintao
a retired Chinese politician who served as General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party from 2002 to 2012, President of the People's Republic of China from 2003 to 2013, and Chairman of the Central Military Commission from 2004 to 2012

Kuomintang
The Nationalist Party = Kuomintang (KMT), under leadership of Sun Yat-sen
Party was aided by student protests and an upwelling of nationalist sentiment that began in 1919 and came to be known as the May Fourth Movement
These nationalist revolts rejected foregin interference in China and called for modernization, radical reform, and a break with traditional values and institutions, including Confucianism
a major political party in the Republic of China throughout its historical periods in both the Chinese mainland as well as Taiwan. It was the dominant ruling party of the Republic of China on the mainland from 1928 to 1949

Long March
Established Moa’s independence communist republic in china, but KMT attacks forced the CCP to flee westward in what is known as the Long March
In this, the CCP and its followers traveled 6,000 miles and lost many lives
Represented a setback for the CCP
Secured Mao’s leadership and strengthened his idea that the party should reorient itself toward China’s peasant majority

National Party Congress
 the National Party Congress “elects” its Central Committee (CC), which in turn “elects” the Politburo
The seven or so members of the Politburo Standing Committee (PSC) make up the top political leadership in China 
CC typically meets annually and carries out the ongoing approval and endorsement functions of the National Party Congress between its sessions
Its members constitutie the pool of China’s party officials who are groomed for top leadership 
The National Party Congress is the party’s cumbersome representative body and somewhat akin to an American political party nominating convention 
Well over 2,000 delegates, the National Party congress is far too unwieldy and meets too infrequently to conduct any real policy making
Its full sessions have been used as venues for announcing changes in policies and leadership and formally endorsing the ideological line of the party 
Has regularly convened at 5-year intervals

National People's Congress
The national constitution designates China’s unicameral legislature, the National People’s Congress (NPC), as the highest organ of the state, the key point to keep in mind is that all government organizations and bureaucratic ministries remain subservient party oversight
State council is appointed by China’s parliament, the National People’s Congress, which serves as china’s unicameral legislative branch
NPC elections are held every 5 years, a schedule observed faithfully only since Mao’s death 
NPC’s roughly 3,000 delegate represent both geographic and functional constituencies
Delegates are elected indirectly by provincial people’s congresses and typically convene annually for about 2 weeks to “elect” a standing committee of 150 members
Top leader of NPC must also be a member of CCP’s Politburo Standing Committee
An arrangement that guarantees party control of legislative affairs and demonstrates the interlocking and hierarchical relationship between party and state
Has constitutional authority to pass laws and amend the constitution, but NPC has never had an independent or influential role in policy making 
It has most often served to ratify policies already determined 
In recent years, NPC and its standing committee have gradually become venues for delegates to offer opinions, express dissatisfaction with government policy, and even occasionally cast dissenting votes 
NPC is far from a democratic parliament
The institution is too large and meets to seldom and too briefly to exert any substantial influence

“One Country, Two systems”

Red Capitalists
private entrepreneurs who belong to the CCP
have benefited from economic reform, prefer social stability, and therefore have little reason the challenge the state or make new demands on the policy agenda 

Red Guards
student radicals
1966, the cult took shape as Mao and his supporters accused the CCP itself of having “taken the capitalist road: and encouraged the public to “bomb the headquarters”
Schools were closed and student radicals, called red guards, took to the streets to act as vanguards and shock troops of Mao’s Cultural Revolution 

Reds vs Experts
Mao and the CCP sought to rapidly industrialize China by launching a crash industrialization campaign called the Great Leap Forward (1958-60)
Mao believed that China’s communist-led masses could be harnesses to carry out rapid industrial growth 
To pursue that goal, he favored a policy of Reds versus experts - setting politically indoctrained party cadres (Reds) over those with economic training (experts)

Reform and Opening
Deng Xiaoping, a top party leader form the earliest years of CCP who had been stripped of his posts during cultural revolution
In race to take control, Deng initially allied with Mao’s successor, Hua Guofend, who had outmaneuvered Mao’s widow and her allies 
They consolidated power and set the nation on a very diff course
Deng pursued monderization at the expense of communist ideology, in what became known as “reform and opening”
Government encouraged the gradual privatization first of rural agriculture and then urban industry  
The government expanded foregin investment and trade while deemphasizing ideology 
Political reform did not take place
CCP maintained complete control over political life
1978, under Deng Xiaoping, economic reform and opening began in fits and starts as the chinese communist leadership shifts its focus from the traditional communist goal of equity to creating rapid economic growth 

Special Econ Zones
an area in which the business and trade laws are different from the rest of the country
SEZs are located within a country's national borders, and their aims include increasing trade balance, employment, increased investment, job creation and effective administration

Three Represents
CCP broadened the definition of the party in a 2001 policy known as the Three Represents to include not just workers and peasants but even private entrepreneurs
This convergence of private financial wealth and political influence, combined with the growing income inequality in chinese society, has led critics to wonder how long a ruling party founded on the principle of destroying the very social class it has chose to embrace and reward can endure
The communist party-state decided in 2001 to welcome private capitalists into the CCP with its Three Represents policy
Leaders argued that under the current conditions of “socialism with Chinese characteristic” the CCP ought to represent the interests not just of workers and presents but also of the private agents of China’s advanced productive forces
This open embraced of what was considered socialism’s class enemy acknowledges the growing economic influence of china’s capitalists and the inevitable pressures from the growing middle class to express its interests
This has also given rise to a growing group of red capitalists - private entrepreneurs who belong to the CCP - who have benefited from economic reform, prefer social stability, and therefore have little reason the challenge the state or make new demands on the policy agenda 

Tiananmen Square
Although these extensive efforts at authoritarian control have thwarted the kind of broad-based resistance manifested in the 1989 demonstration of students and their supports at Tiananmen Square, a variety of social protests have bubbled up outside the official confines of the party-state
May 17, hundred of thousands of protesters gathered in Tiananmen Square
 troops armed with assault rifles and accompanied by tanks fired at the demonstrators and those trying to block the military's advance into Tiananmen Square.

Deng Xiaoping
Most known for his reform and opening policy
Sun Yat-sen
Leader of the KMT
Mao Zedong
Leader of the communist party
Led the long march 
Failed in his plan for industrialization through the great leap forward
Jiang Zemin

IRAN
Mahmoud Ahmadinejad
When Khatami stepped down in 2005, many expected that former president and Khatami backer Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani would return to power
Rafsanjani was trounced by the mayor of Tehran, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad
Ahmadinejad benefited from the absence of many pro-reform voters who had stayed away from the polls because they were dismayed by the conservative counteroffensive in the Majlis and repelled by Rafsanjani, who was viewed as corrupt
Widespread support for Ahmadinejad among the poor and more conservative, whole were attracted by his obvious piety and modesty 


Assembly of Experts
a body of 88 members, all men and Islamic scholars, who are themselves popularly elected for 8 year terms
According to the constitution, the assembly may remove the supreme leader if he fails to discharge his constitutional duties, creating at least in theory the capacity for the body to oversee the Council in advance of elections, limiting the people’s choice and ensuring that membership is dominated by clerics who accept the political status quo
There are direct elections for the Assembly of Experts
The assembly of experts use a single-member district system, though win no runoff

Ayatollah
Shiism has been long connected to, if not directly involved in, politics
The Safavids cultivated within Shiism’s religious leaders (or ulema) a higher clergy, who came to be known as ayatollahs
This strucute differs from the more decentalized Sunni Islam, and these high-ranking clergy have become a central institution in modern Iranian religion and politics
As US pressure on the shah flagged, Iranians found a second source of external opposition to his repressive rule: the ayatollah Khomeini
1978, the Iranian government attempted a smear campaign against Khomeini, which only increased support for the Ayatollah and touched off a series of protests
The government responded harshly, but this in turn sparked a new round of conflict, linked to a 40-day cycle of mourning traditionally undertaken in Islam

Basij
During the Iran-Iraq War, the Revolutionary Guard expanded in size to fight on the front lines as a military force
It did this in part relying on a large people’s volunteer militia, known as Basij, which had been formed shortly after the revolution as a grassroots civil defense force
Its members were poorly trainings and ill-equipped but imbued with religious and nationalist fervor, and the Basji were known for its human wave attack against the Iraqi front lines
The Basji is no longer a significant military force, thought it has maintained its importance in other wars
The organization has developed substantial economic assets
More disturbing has been its role in public morality force, often taking responsibility for such things as preventing displays of affection and seizing illegal satellite dishes
Basji members tend to come from poorer backgrounds, and membership is an opportunity to gain access to certain benefits, such as higher education


Bonyads
The private industries’ assets were turned over to several bonyads, or parastatal foundations
Objective of bonyads = to help the disadvantaged, such as war veterans or the poor
Over time, the boneyards have become major economic players and often monopolies, controlling substantials assets and industries while operating independently of government oversight or taxation
Revolutionary Guard is one major actor with significant assets entrusted with its own bonyad and related businesses, which has helped to enrich those within the organization
Compared with oil, the bonyads, and the state, the private sector is relatively small and dominated by small-scale businesses

Chief Justice
a single figure whose qualifications include an understanding of Sharia
Chief justice is appointed by the supreme leader for a 5-year term
Beneath the chief justice is the supreme court, which serves as the highest court of appeal

Expediency Council
Members of the Expediency Council are appointed by the supreme leader for 5-year terms; until his death in 2017, the council was headed by Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, a longstanding rival to Khamenei
Final decision of Expediency Council cannot be overturned
The Guardian Council (and to a lesser extend, the Expediency Council) serves as a kind of unelected upper house with substantial powers to restrict the work of the Majlis

Farsi
National language of Iran
remained the tongue of the people, though it adopted many arabic loan words and the arabic script

Guardian Council
Guardian Council is made up of 12 individuals who serve 6-year phased terms: six are lawyers nominated by the chief justice and approved by Majlis; six are clerics specializing in religious law and appointed by supreme leader
Powers are the guardian council are significant
Power to review all legislation that derives from the Majlis to ensure it compatibility with the criteria of Islam and the Constitution 
May send legislation back to Majlis for revision if it finds the legislation incompatible 
If Majlis are unable to revise it to the Guardian Council’s satisfaction, the Expediency Council mediates

Imams
The imams are the true leaders of the faith, though these descendents have been repeatedly deprived of power by other Muslim leaders
The last of these imams, known as the Mahdi, or “guided one” has been concealed by God and is expected by the Shia to reappear at the end of time to restore justice and equality to corrupted world

Iran-Iraq War
As the Iranian revolution unfolded, Iraq’s authoritarian leader, Saddam Hussien, perceived these developments as a threat to his own rule over a country in which more than half the population was Shiite
In september 1980, Iraq launched a full-scale invasion of Iran, initiating the Iran-Iraq War, which lasted until 1988
War caused widespread destruction on both sides

Islamic Republic of Iran
Official name of Iran, previously known as Persia 

Islamism
Iran is  a country associated with Islamism, or Islamic fundamentalism
Fundamentalism = a view of religion as absolute and inerrant that should be legally enforced by making faith the sovereign authority

Ali Khamenei
The second and current supreme leader of Iran, in office since 1989
Previously the third president of Iran from 1981 to 1989

Mohammad Khatami
1997 election of president Mohammad Khatami, who spoke of an expansion of civil society and a “dialogue of civilizations” in place of international conflict 
 served as the fifth president of Iran from 3 August 1997 to 3 August 2005
He was critical of the government of subsequent President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad

Ruhollah Khomeini
Ayatollah Khomeini
1st supreme leader of Iran
As US pressure on the shah flagged, Iranians found a second source of external opposition to his repressive rule: the ayatollah Khomeini
in  Khomeini’s book, he argued that Islamic government show be constructed around the concept of velayat-e faqih, a cleric rule; whereas a monarchy was a usurpation oh Allah’s rule on earth, a system of government led by a clergy trained in Islamic jurisprudence would be a continuation of the political system first established by the prophet Mohammad
1978, the Iranian government attempted a smear campaign against Khomeini, which only increased support for the Ayatollah and touched off a series of protests

Mahdi
For many shiite leaders, their quietest vision, which dominated Iranian Shiism before the revolution, emphasizes that worldly political power cannot be reunited with Islam until the return of the Mahdi
The last of these imams, known as the Mahdi, or “guided one” has been concealed by God and is expected by the Shia to reappear at the end of time to restore justice and equality to corrupted world

Majlis
The legislature, or Majlis, is a unicameral body whose members are directly elected on the basis of universal suffrage of men and women over 18
The Majlis have a limited amount of authority
Its powers influence initiating and passing legislation, overseeing the budget, and approving members of the president’s cabinet
Cabinet members may also be removed by a vote of no confidence, though the Majli’s power in this area does not extent to the president or to the supreme leader
The Majlis is also an important instrument of local politics, used by representatives to gain resources for their constituents through the kind of work barreling seen in most parliaments around the world
The broader limitations of the Majlis are best seen in the presence of two additional bodies, the Guardian Council and the Expediency Council
There are direct elections for the Majlis
For the Majlis, Iran uses a combination of single member and multi member districts
In the single-member districts, the candidate with the largest share of the vote wins the seat (as long as its over 25%)
In multimember districts with more than one seat, voters cast votes for each seat, with similar runoffs if needed

Mohammad Mosaddeq
Nationalization was advocated in particular by the new prime minister, Mohammad Mosaddeq, who represented the National Front, a republican party that favored reducing the power of the monarchy or eliminating it altogether
Mosaddeq’s actions were directed toward the goals of national sovereignty and modernization
His nationalization of oil generated deep British animosity, while his secularism and republicanism alienated many of the ulema
With the Shah’s support, the US and the UK moved to overthrow Mosaddeq through a covert program known as Operation Ajax
Many of the ulema welcomed Mosaddeq’s overthrow bc they feared he would impose secularism on Iran
In many way, Mosaddeq’s actions - his calls for greater national sovereignty in the face of western imperialism and his opposition to the shah - can be seen as a forerunner to the 1979 revolution
Since 1979 he has been a problematic figure for Iranian leaders because of his unstinting secularism - a reminder of a political path that Iran did not take

National Front
 republican party that favored reducing the power of the monarchy or eliminating it altogether

Operation Ajax
With the Shah’s support, the US and the UK moved to overthrow Mosaddeq through a covert program known as Operation Ajax
In the aftermath of Operation Ajax, hundreds of national front and tudeh leaders and supporters were arrested, and several key leaders were executed
The overthrow of the democratically elected Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddegh in favor of strengthening the monarchical rule of the Shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi on 19 August 1953

Reza Shah Pahlavi
Reza Shah Pahlavi, as Reza Khan renamed himself, proved to be more than a mere puppet of the British
On becoming half of the armed forces, he quickly moved to consolidate his power, removing his fellow conspirators from office and neutralizing threats within and outside Iran
1923, the last Shah of the Qajar Dynasty appointed Reza Khan prime minister and promptly went into exile in Europe
In 1925, the Majlis formally deposed the Qajar dynasty and appointed Reza Khan the new shah
Initially he did not want to be monarch - he favored a republican form of government with a powerful unelected president, along the lines of post-ottoman turkey 
Many of the clergy saw a secular republican government as dangerous to the faith (an issue that first emerged in the Constitutional Revolution)

Persia
Outside Iran, Persian continues to be a common name used to describe the majority population of the country
Until 1935, the country itself was officially known as Persia

Quietist
Quietism, a doctrine of Christian spirituality that, in general, holds that perfection consists in passivity (quiet) of the soul, in the suppression of human effort so that divine action may have full play

Revolutionary Guard
The Revolutionary Guard is a paramilitary force that emerged from the 1979 revolution
It originally comprised several thousand men from various militias and groups that had sprung up around the revolution and was independent of the armed force, which Khomeini mistrusted bc of their role during Pahlavi dynasty 
The Revolutionary Guard was assigned the immediate task of defending the new regime and destroying rival groups and movements, such as marxists and supporters of greater ehtnic autonomy 
During the Iran-Iraq War, the Revolutionary Guard expanded in size to fight on the front lines as a military force
It did this in part relying on a large people’s volunteer militia, known as Basij, which had been formed shortly after the revolution as a grassroots civil defense force
Its members were poorly trainings and ill-equipped but imbued with religious and nationalist fervor, and the Basji were known for its human wave attack against the Iraqi front lines
Though both groups are controlled by the supreme leader and his allies, the revolutionary guard has become an increasingly independent and direct player in Ionic domestic and international affairs
The Guard has its own ministry, army, navy, and air force units as well as an unclear role in the development of Iran’s nuclear program
It has been active in the region, providing training and some troops in ongoing conflicts with Iraq and Syria, and has been associated with past acts of terrorism  
At home, the Guard has become deeply involved in the Iranian economy
It has significant economic assets and is involved in various aspects of national development, such as construction, banking, and telecommunications
The Guard leadships is also highly factionalized 

SAVAK
The Shah repressed opposition parties and built a powerful secret police (known as SAVAK); also marginalized the PM and Majlis
Many iranians latched onto the rumor that SAVAK torched the theater in an attempted to dream the religious opposition (reality = islamic radical started the first)

Sharia
It is God’s law (Sharia) that should reign supreme
The iranian constitution and political institutions are (in theory) an attempt to express God’s will 
The legal system in Iran is derived from religious law, or Sharia, in which the notion of rule of law is viewed as an attempt by the people to assume legal authority where God should be sovereign

Shiism
Under Safavids, the country adopted Shiism as the state religion as a way to differentiate the country from its Ottoman rivals, who were Sunni
Shiism differs from dominant Sunni Islam by arguing that leadership within the Islamic community has been entrusted by God to the family and bloodline of the prophet Muhammad
From Muhammad’s son in-law Ali on down, according to the Shia, the imams are the true leaders of the faith, though these descendents have been repeatedly deprived of power by other Muslim leaders
The last of these imams, known as the Mahdi, or “guided one” has been concealed by God and is expected by the Shia to reappear at the end of time to restore justice and equality to corrupted world
In this regard, Shiism resembles Christianity

Theocracy
A system of government in which priests rule in the name of God or a god

Ummah
the whole community of Muslims bound together by ties of religion
Most civil organizations were either absorbed into the state or outlawed
This move was consistent with the theocracy’s particular interpretation of the concept of the ummah, or community, whose members were expected to act as a unified group that embodied and served the revolution

Velayat-e faqih
Political conservatives (“principalists” as they have recently called themselves) support the velayat-e faqih and oppose democratization or the return of faith to a primarily social, as opposed to political, role
Faith must be a central institution within the state, guiding politics and society toward God’s intent
This vision implies that pious rule can hasten the Mahdi’s return
They have significant advantage in their support by the Revolutionary Guard, which make the prospects for liberalization much more daunting
A cleric rule

White Revolution
The shah revived the policy of top-down modernization that his father had promoted 
Once again, the policy had the effect of organizing the Ulema
Its reforms, starting in 1963, were known as the white revolution
A far-reaching series of reforms resulting in aggressive modernization in Iran launched on 26 January 1963 by the Shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, which lasted until 1979


Iran vs. Iraq relations
War between them bc of religious disputes, land disputes, ethnic disputes
In effect, helps solidify power of Iranian conservatives and in a lot of ways helps the roots of this new regime hold power
During war, status quo gets solidified
Iraq currently has better relations with the US than Iran does
American Invasion of Iraq in 2003
Because…
Thought they had weapons of mass destruction and were a threat to american allies (Israel)
Thought they had to do with the terrorist attacks of 9/11
Found that they had neither of those two factors once they invaded
It created a power vacuum by removing Saddam Hussein
US removed the biggest adversary of Iran from the region, and in doing so strengthened Iran's power over Iraq and strengthened Shiite power in Iraq
Allows Iran to help fund and provide for militias who go against american interests

Iranian Relationship with
Israel
Pretty bad relationship
Often blame israel for problems and use it for excuse for bombings and attacks
Iran doesn’t directly attack Israel, but does it in proxy ways
By funding terrorist groups
Reasons for not liking israel = 
Dont think the country should exist and believe it is the palestinian land
See Israel as a puppet state for the United States
Israel is a very strong and very wealthy country and a nuclear power
Very strong bc backed by the United States
Israel is the most aggressive country in the world against Iran
Launching drone strikes, etc. against Iran
Going and assassinating iranian scientists and nuclear engineers
Saudi Arabia
Proxy wars
Disagree on religion, ethnicity, language, and are competing for oil
In order to put a check on a growing Iran, the US tolerates Saudi Arabia and has arms deals with them, supplies a lot of energy in the form of oil, and acts as a check
Russia
Pretty good terms
With Russia invading Ukraine, Iran supported the Russians
Iran exports things to Russia
Trade partners
Russia is a military ally to Iran
Russia gets more power and influence in the middle east
Does what the US does not want
Simplifies Russia’s actions in Syria and explains why Iran is supportive and quiet of invasion of Ukraine
China
Heavily inclined to help Iran
Trade partners
Belt and Road Initiative
Economic opportunities
Puts a check on western influence and also a lot of economic benefits
Iran want to build something similar to the firewall of china
United States
Enemies
