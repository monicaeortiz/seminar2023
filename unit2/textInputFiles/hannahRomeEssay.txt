In ancient Rome, emperors utilized art and architecture to promote their public image and increase the legitimacy of their rule. Emperors like Agustus, Vespasian, and Trajan created pieces of art that reminded the Roman people of their power, and in turn this helped create glorified images of themselves that would be remembered for years to come. 
	The Augustus of Primaporta, which was originally a bronze statue made around 20 CE, portrays Augustus as an ideal and powerful emperor, which was done intentionally to glorify his image and make the public respect him. The contrapposto of the statue is reminiscent of the Greek Doryphoros, which was seen to be the ideal human form. By copying that pose in his statute, Augustus portrays himself as the ideal person, which helps to strengthen his image. In addition, he appears very young and capable in the statue, which is seen in the features of his face and his outstretched arm, indicating that he is a powerful leader addressing his troops. Furthermore, there are many details on Augustus' armor that show he is powerful and sophisticated, which help to glorify his image. The images of Caelus, Sol, and Tellus connect to Augustus' belief that he was of divine descent, which makes him a figure of high importance in the eyes of the Roman people. In addition, the smaller statue of cupid at Augustus' feet further alludes to his divine descent, and helps to glorify his image as it makes the people respect him and his ancestry. Cupid is riding a dolphin, which is another feature that creates a positive image of Augustus because it refers to his victory in the naval battle of Actium. In this battle, he defeated Mark Antony and Cleopatra, which expanded Rome's influence across the Mediterranean and officially started the empire. This proves that Augustus was a powerful leader, and the battle's role in the statue is a way for Augustus to glorify his image because it reminds the people of his great accomplishments.  
When Vepasian was emperor, he built the colosseum, which was a large amphitheater made of stone that was completed in 80 CE. The Colosseum was built over the former site of Nero's Palace, and because Nero was disliked among the Roman people, they were glad his memory was being erased from the city. This glorified Vespasian because by getting rid of Nero, he appeared like a heroic and powerful leader, which made people think highly of him. In addition, the creation of the Colosseum was intended to appeal to the masses, and it was a piece of architecture that was accessible to all Roman citizens. This further improved Vespasian's reputation because the Romans felt like he had made something for them, and they could go there to watch the entertainment and enjoy themselves. Furthermore, since the venue was used primarily for entertainment, Vespasian was able to use it to push his political agenda and ideas to the public by having shows that would make him seem like a strong and powerful ruler. The engineering of the Colosseum is also very impressive and required lots of resources to construct, which also helps glorify Vespasian since it shows that under his rule Rome was very advanced and wealthy. 
Similarly, Trajan created impressive pieces of architecture to commemorate his rule and display his power to the Roman people. The Column of Trajan, which sits in Trajan's Forum, is a tall stone monument that was constructed in 112 CE after Trajan's defeat of Dacia. This defeat further expanded the Roman Empire, and proved that Trajan was a powerful and capable leader. This monument depicts the scenes of his defeat of the Dacians, which display Trajan's values and help glorify him to the Roman people. For example, some of the scenes on the column show sacrifices being made to the gods, which encourages people to respect the Roman religion and in turn respect Trajan. In addition, there are scenes of Trajan commanding his troops, and because it is on the column it is a reminder to the people of Trajan's excellent leadership qualities, further showing how emperors used art to glorify their image. On the column, there is also the inclusion of Trajan sparing women, which helps his image because it shows that he is respectful of everyone, and it also makes the citizens trust and respect him. While it has been replaced with a statue of Saint Peter, there was a large statue of Trajan that stood at the top of the column, which was important because it reminded the Romans that Trajan was a very powerful leader as he was able to conquer vast swaths of territory and help the empire reach its height. 
Augustus, Vespasian, and Trajan were all very powerful emperors, but their use of art and architecture made the Roman people think highly of them and helped glorify their images. They were able to appeal to the people through art and made it possible for everyone to experience the benefits of their rule.
